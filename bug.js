This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a custom native module.  The error message might vary slightly, but it typically indicates that the module cannot be found or loaded.  It might manifest as a blank screen, a crash, or a specific error message in the Expo Go console.  The root cause is often a mismatch between the native module's configuration and how Expo Go attempts to load it.
