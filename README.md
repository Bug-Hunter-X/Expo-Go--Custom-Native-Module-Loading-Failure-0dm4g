# Expo Go: Custom Native Module Loading Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using custom native modules with Expo Go. The problem arises from misconfigurations that prevent Expo Go from properly loading and linking the necessary native code.

## Problem Description

When attempting to run an Expo app using Expo Go that relies on a custom native module, the app may fail to load, resulting in a blank screen, crash, or an error message in the Expo Go console.  This typically occurs due to inconsistencies between the native module's setup and Expo Go's expectations.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully verifying the native module's integration with the Expo project, ensuring correct configurations in package.json, app.json, and the native module's Android/iOS project files (if applicable).  This includes properly setting up build configurations and dependencies.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run the app using `expo start` and Expo Go.
4. Observe the error message in Expo Go's console.
5. Examine the solution file (bugSolution.js) to see how the problem is corrected.
