The solution often involves double-checking several key areas:

1. **package.json:** Ensure all native module dependencies are correctly listed and their versions are compatible with Expo and the native module itself.
2. **app.json:** Verify that the necessary native modules are declared correctly.  Expo's documentation provides specific guidance on how to declare native modules in `app.json`.
3. **Native Module Configuration (Android/iOS):**  The specific configuration steps depend on the native module and its setup.  Make sure all native files are correctly compiled and linked with the Expo project. Check for any error logs during the build process. 
4. **Expo Build:** If you can't solve it with Expo Go, try building the app using `expo prebuild` or `eas build`. This can help isolate whether the problem stems from the Expo Go environment itself or from misconfigurations within the native module.

The `bugSolution.js` file will contain a corrected version of the code that addresses the misconfiguration(s) in the native module setup.
